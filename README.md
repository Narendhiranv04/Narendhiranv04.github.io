# Narendhiranv04.github.io

Minimal profile site for Narendhiran Vijayakumar, highlighting robotics and AI research, publications, projects, skills,
and leadership. The layout follows a clean single-page structure so it can be served directly from GitHub Pages.

## Local development

You can preview the site locally with any static file server. One option included with Python is `http.server`:

```bash
python -m http.server 4000
```

Then open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.

## Structure

- `index.html` – page markup
- `assets/css/styles.css` – global styles and layout
- `assets/js/main.js` – mobile navigation toggle and footer year helper

All styles and scripts are handwritten so the page has no build step or external dependencies beyond the hosted fonts.
