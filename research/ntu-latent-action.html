            Moto-VLA looked solid on paper until I realised it was still picking actions because scenes looked familiar, not
            because the robot actually knew what to do. This internship is my attempt to fix that by retrieving and conditioning on
            actions instead of appearance.

            <strong>Spark.</strong>
            I walked into this thinking robot manipulation was kind of “solved” and “saturated”. How naive of me. Then I found
            VLAs and realised how wrong that was. Got me intrigued about generalist policies and “Embodied AI” – sounded way too
            interesting for me to ignore. As I read randomly through a lot of papers, I realised the space is exciting and chaotic
            at the same time–lots of big demos, but also lots of cases where the robot looks at a scene, finds something that looks
            similar, and still doesn’t know what to do. That pushed me to a simple question: instead of retrieving by appearance,
            can we retrieve by robot action instead?
          </p>

          <p class="research-article__text">
            <strong>Idea.</strong>
            The core idea is to represent short chunks of motion as compact “latent action” snippets—little summaries of intent and
            phase like “approach,” “close,” “lift,” rather than just pixels. I started by training a VAE model with contrastive loss
            (InfoNCE) to learn these embeddings from demonstrations, so segments that do the same thing end up close together, even
            if they look different. From there, I built a small retrieval system: slice trajectories into sub-trajectories, align
            them with DTW so timing lines up, index them with FAISS, and then score neighbours with cosine similarity. The point is
            to fetch the right action examples for the current moment, not just the most similar frame.
          </p>

          <p class="research-article__text">
            <strong>First look.</strong>
            At first, this worked—but only a little. Latent-action retrieval beat plain image retrieval in a few rollouts (better
            contact timing, fewer failures), but the gains were thin. Two problems popped out. One: my “positives” were too loose.
            Clips that looked similar weren’t always in the same phase. Tightening positives to phase-aligned windows and mining
            harder negatives made the embedding space sharper. Two: I was teaching the model with latent actions during training
            but asking it to rely on images at test time. That mismatch was the bigger issue.
          </p>

          <p class="research-article__text">
            <strong>Closing the gap.</strong>
            To fix it, I added an in-context memory at inference. For each step, I retrieve the top-K latent-action snippets and
            hand them to the policy as simple, structured context—“here are a few examples of what to do now.” The policy can then
            attend to those action cues while deciding the next move. That change felt small on paper, but it made the difference:
            the policy actually uses action structure at test time, not just during training.
          </p>

          <p class="research-article__text">
            <strong>Annoying struggles.</strong>
            There was a fair amount of engineering glue to make this stable. I standardised everything to a clean [B, T, D] shape
            contract, added checks to avoid the usual time-dim confusion, chunked FAISS queries to keep memory in check, cached
            neighbours between steps, and moved heavy paths to mixed precision. None of that is glamorous, but it turned “sometimes
            works” into “runs reliably enough to iterate” and actually publishable, and not just showcasing a few good rollouts.
          </p>

          <p class="research-article__text">
            <strong>Why it matters.</strong>
            Where this fits in the bigger VLA picture: a lot of current systems blur appearance with intent. They can find a scene
            that looks right and still miss the moment to make contact or the tempo of a motion. By retrieving and conditioning on
            actions, the policy gets a lightweight prior about what should happen next. It doesn’t solve everything (long-horizon
            chaining is still tricky, and sim-to-real will always be the real test), but it’s a clean way to push beyond “it looks
            similar, so try this.”
          </p>

          <p class="research-article__text">
            <strong>Status.</strong>
            Right now I have three pieces wired together: a latent-action tokenizer (trained with InfoNCE), a FAISS index over
            DTW-aligned sub-trajectories, and an in-context cache that hands the policy a few retrieved action snippets at test
            time. When it helps, it’s for very specific reasons: repeated sub-motions line up better, and the policy stops
            second-guessing short, well-defined phases. When it doesn’t help, it’s also clear why: cluttered scenes or lighting
            shifts pull the wrong neighbours, and a bad retrieval can nudge the policy off course. There’s a small latency tax from
            retrieval, but it stays reasonable if I keep K tiny and cache across steps.
          </p>

          <p class="research-article__text">
            <strong>Next up.</strong>
            What I still need to nail down are the boring but important choices: the window length for tokenisation, how much DTW
            slack is healthy, which distance works best beyond plain cosine, and how many examples (K) actually add signal before
            the context turns noisy. After that, I’ll try it on xArm manipulator to find the failure modes I can’t see in sim. A lot
            of exciting stuff is yet to be done!
          </p>

          <p class="research-article__closing">
            If I had to sum it up in one line: Isn’t the real goal to stop matching by how things look and instead retrieve, and
            condition on what to do, so the robot learns intent rather than just images?
