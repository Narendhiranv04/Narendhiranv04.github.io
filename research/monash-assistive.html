            I distilled a gated recurrent network to 68k parameters and paired it with a fuzzy supervisor so our sit-to-walk
            exoskeleton could deliver torque inside 20 ms. The work centred on feeling invisible to the wearer while staying
            accurate under noisy IMU and EMG signals.

            <strong>Challenge.</strong>
            Sit-to-walk transitions punish latency. If the assistive torque lags by more than a few milliseconds the wearer feels a
            drag. We needed a controller that predicted joint torques almost instantaneously while handling variable gait phases.
          </p>

          <p class="research-article__text">
            <strong>Approach.</strong>
            I pruned the feature set to the most informative IMU and EMG channels, built a compact GRU, and wrapped it with a fuzzy
            supervisor that modulates assistance based on gait-phase confidence. The result was a model small enough to live on an
            embedded Jetson.
          </p>

          <p class="research-article__text">
            <strong>Iterating.</strong>
            Quantisation plus tensor core inference were key to hitting our timing budget. With mixed-precision kernels we kept
            inference under 20 ms without sacrificing fidelity, and the controller stopped feeling like it was chasing the user.
          </p>

          <p class="research-article__text">
            <strong>What we learned.</strong>
            The fuzzy layer smoothed out torque spikes caused by imperfect foot contact, dropping peak error by 18%. Test subjects
            stopped noticing the controller catching up—the assistance felt native rather than corrective.
          </p>

          <p class="research-article__text">
            <strong>Reflection.</strong>
            Assistive robotics is equal parts empathy and engineering. Every watt has to arrive in sync with the wearer’s intent, and
            the controller should disappear into the motion.
          </p>

          <p class="research-article__closing">
            Lightweight models can still feel heavy—unless you design for the human first.
